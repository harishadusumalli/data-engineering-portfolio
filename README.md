# 🚀 Data Engineering Portfolio
### A growing collection of my data engineering projects, practice problems, and learning resources.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is structured into three main sections:

- **`projects/`** → Real-world data engineering projects (ETL, SQL optimization, etc.)
- **`practice/`** → Python, SQL, and Spark coding problems for revision.
- **`cheatsheets/`** → Quick reference notes on SQL, Python, and Spark.

## 🔨 Work in Progress
This repository is a work in progress. I will be adding:
- End-to-end data engineering projects.
- Python, SQL, and Spark coding exercises.
- Useful notes and cheatsheets for quick revision.

## 🚀 Goals of This Repo
✅ Build a strong **data engineering portfolio** for job applications.  
✅ Maintain a **collection of solved coding problems** for revision.  
✅ Create **cheatsheets for quick reference** during interviews.

## 📌 Next Steps
- [ ] Add my first data engineering project.
- [ ] Start uploading Python and SQL practice problems.
- [ ] Create my first cheatsheet on SQL optimizations.
