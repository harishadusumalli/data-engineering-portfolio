# ðŸš€ Data Engineering Portfolio
### A growing collection of my data engineering projects, practice problems, and learning resources.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
This repository is structured into three main sections:

- **`projects/`** â†’ Real-world data engineering projects (ETL, SQL optimization, etc.)
- **`practice/`** â†’ Python, SQL, and Spark coding problems for revision.
- **`cheatsheets/`** â†’ Quick reference notes on SQL, Python, and Spark.

## ðŸ”¨ Work in Progress
This repository is a work in progress. I will be adding:
- End-to-end data engineering projects.
- Python, SQL, and Spark coding exercises.
- Useful notes and cheatsheets for quick revision.

## ðŸš€ Goals of This Repo
âœ… Build a strong **data engineering portfolio** for job applications.  
âœ… Maintain a **collection of solved coding problems** for revision.  
âœ… Create **cheatsheets for quick reference** during interviews.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- [ ] Added my first data engineering project.
- [ ] Start uploading Python and SQL practice problems.
- [ ] Create my first cheatsheet on SQL optimizations.
